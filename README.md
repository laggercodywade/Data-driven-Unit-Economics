# Data Driven Unit Economics

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive, data-driven approach to calculating and analyzing key Unit Economics metrics for a business. By leveraging real operational and financial data, the notebook guides users through the process of collecting, processing, and interpreting the following core metrics:

- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** The average cost to acquire a new customer.
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User):** The average revenue generated per customer.
- **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold):** The direct costs associated with delivering products or services.
- **Gross Margin:** The percentage of revenue retained after accounting for COGS.
- **LTV (Customer Lifetime Value):** The total expected value a customer brings over their lifecycle.
- **LTV/CAC Ratio:** A key indicator of the efficiency and sustainability of customer acquisition strategies.

Each section of the notebook includes clear explanations, step-by-step data processing, and transparent calculations, making it easy to adapt the methodology to other datasets or business contexts.

## Summary of Results

- **CAC:** Calculated by aggregating CRM, marketing, and sales payroll expenses, then dividing by the number of new customers acquired in the period.
- **ARPU:** Determined by dividing total revenue by the number of active customers in the most recent month.
- **COGS:** Summed from production-related expenses, shared software costs (allocated proportionally), and engineering payroll.
- **Gross Margin:** Expressed as a percentage, showing the proportion of revenue remaining after COGS.
- **LTV:** Estimated using ARPU, average customer lifespan, and gross margin.
- **LTV/CAC Ratio:** Indicates the return on investment for customer acquisition efforts.

## Conclusion

The analysis of Unit Economics provides actionable insights into the businessâ€™s operational efficiency and growth potential:

- **A healthy LTV/CAC ratio (typically >3)** suggests that the business is generating strong value from its customer base relative to acquisition costs, supporting sustainable growth.
- **If the ratio is below 1**, acquisition costs outweigh the value generated, signaling a need to optimize marketing spend, improve retention, or increase revenue per user.
- **Gross Margin** and **ARPU** trends help identify opportunities for cost control and revenue enhancement.
- **Regular monitoring** of these metrics is essential for informed decision-making and long-term business health.

**Recommendation:**  
Continue tracking these metrics monthly. If the LTV/CAC ratio falls below target, consider strategies to reduce CAC, increase ARPU, or improve customer retention to enhance LTV.
